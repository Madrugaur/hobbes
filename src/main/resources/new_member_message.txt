Hello {MENTION} Welcome to the RIT Squad! :grin: We just need to take care of a couple of housekeeping :house: things to get you started:
:one: Please change your nickname to your actual name so that everyone can tell who you are and they can easily talk to you!
:two: Go to {ROLE_CLAIM} to claim a role! If you want to make a new role, just reach out to one of the guys in yellow and they'll help you out!
And that's all folks! :sunglasses:
Have fun being part of the coolest server at RIT!
